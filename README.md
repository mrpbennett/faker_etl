### Implementation Tips

1. **Use a Data Classification Tool:** Tag data by country origin to apply the correct workflow automatically.
2. **Automate Compliance Checks:** Leverage tools like DataDog, BigID, or OneTrust to ensure adherence.
3. **Regular Updates:** Keep workflows updated to reflect changes in privacy laws (e.g., CCPA, India's DPDP Act).
4. **Data Retention Policies:** Define retention periods for each country group and automate data deletion when needed.

Would you like these workflows in a specific format (e.g., JSON, YAML, or as Python code for integration)?
